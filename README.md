A FoundryVTT library that provides many helper methos to manage data and send it around. This is useful
for creating a reliable way of storing and interacting with data that is tricky to manage, such as
big JSONs and cache files, as long as making it way easier to correctly load, save and send this data.
You just need to call the API and leave the hard work for Packets :D

### Note for Developers (modules and macros)
Take a look at the [Documentation](https://modules.zoty.dev/packets/introduction.html)
